## A square peg in a round hole

When I was 17 years old I decided to leave my parents' house to move to a city 600 km away. The reason? I've just won a scolarship to prepare to one of the hardest engineering admission tests in Brazil. 

When reminiscing about that time now I realize how young I (or anyone) was to make such a life changing decision but that's food for thought.

The reason I'm telling you this is, this was the first of MANY experiences in my life so far that I would look around and realise I was one of the few women in the room. In there I think *maybe*. we were 15 out of 100. This percentage wouldn't vary much in the following years.

I remember elaborating a fucked up syllogism in one of the first weeks fueled my *also* fucked up self-esteem back then: 
I am in the midst of the smartest people in the country ->
Most of them are men ->
I am not a man ->
Therefore I'll never be able to be as smart as them ->
Therefore I'm in the wrong place!!

Don't get me wrong, almost 10 years later I know enough about how society works to understand how ridiculous this reasoning was. 

But at that time, in my 17-year-old mind that was enough to fill me with a crippling imposter syndrome that followed me for years. A big white elephant in every single romm I entered - that right now is more like an obnoxious puppy dog that follows me around and sometimes jumps all over me but at least I can shoo it away... I would be lying if I told you it's not still there.

Either way, I didn't give up on STEM because of that, I actually just graduated in Computer Engineering. Even feeling like a square peg in a round hole during all these years I kept pushing through because the idea of giving up on my passion for physics and maths and my (**very idealistic**) dream of becoming an engineer was way worse.

My point is: being a woman in STEM is hard on your confidence. At least it was hard on mine. And I think it's important to talk about it.

After all be honest: when you think of a Computer Engineer, what image comes to mind?

Chances are your mind came up with: a tech bro in a hoodie holed up in a garage, or an awkward nerd with thick glasses and a fondness for tabletop games. Of course pop culture doesn't help with that stereotype either, think Mr Robot, The Big Bang Theory, Silicon Valley.

So honestly I don't blame myself for internalizing the steriotype.

I graduated expecting that feeling to disappear. After all, I had done it: made it through years of feeling out of place, linear algebra, algorithm analysis, and compilers. And it mostly did. 

This post is me trying to make sense of that. Why? Because if there's any chance you're a woman starting out in STEM and feeling like I did, I want you to know you're not alone.


## A brief history of women in computing

One of the most helpful things to unlearn stereotypes is understanding their origins. At least in my case, when I fear or feel some type of way about soemthing I like to learn the most I can about it. 

Fun fact: it's exactly what I did with airplanes. I was so afraid of flying as a kid that I ended up reading everything I could about aerodynamics, flight mechanics, and airplane safety statistics. Safe to say that the fear is gone now.

It’s easy to forget that this hasn’t always been the case. Programming once had a very different gender balance, one that history has largely smoothed over. What feels normal now is, in fact, relatively recent.

In the early decades of computing, programming was not viewed as an elite technical pursuit. It was treated as careful, repetitive, and detail-oriented work—closer to clerical labor than engineering—and was therefore considered suitable for women. Many of the people who wrote the first programs, debugged early systems, and established foundational practices were women. Their work was essential, but rarely framed as exceptional.

As computing gained status, pay, and cultural prestige, the perception of who “belonged” in the field shifted with it. Programming became recast as difficult, abstract, and masculine. Hiring practices changed. Narratives changed. The people who had been there from the beginning were gradually written out of the story.

The result is the imbalance that now feels natural in classrooms like mine—an outcome often mistaken for a reflection of interest or aptitude, rather than the product of a long and quiet redefinition of the field itself.

I had to learn python was a stupid and easy language to learn depite the python community being the only ones i felt confortable - if you know the program pyladies, i was later a volunteer to teach
