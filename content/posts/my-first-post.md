## A square peg in a round hole
Close your eyes and picture a computer engineering graduate. What comes to mind?

Chances are, the image is one of two familiar types: a tech bro in a hoodie, holed up in a dark garage and lost in code, or an awkward nerd with thick glasses and a fondness for tabletop games.

Neither of them looks like me. For a long time, that gap shaped how I understood my place in the field.

So I internalized the stereotype. Because I didn’t fit it, I assumed the problem was me—my interests, my demeanor, my way of occupying the room. The absence of people who resembled me made that belief difficult to unlearn.

Yet I graduated expecting that feeling to disappear. After all, I had done it: finished university, persisted as one of the few women in the room, and made it through years of feeling out of place, linear algebra, algorithm analysis, and compilers. That should have settled it. It mostly did, but why is it that i have a voice in my

It has been six years since I began university. In 2019, I was accepted into computer engineering at UNICAMP. The year was marked by an unusually dense accumulation of firsts.

I was adjusting to a sudden expansion of social life while simultaneously confronting calculus, linear algebra, physics, and the task of learning to program. ChatGPT didn’t exist yet, and the impression—accurate or not—was that everyone else already knew how to code.

I hadn’t printed a hello world in Python, yet I was expected to implement nontrivial data structures in C. This was before large language models, so learning involved building a left-leaning red–black tree from scratch, well before I understood pointers. I did learn, eventually. After a few sleepless nights.

## A brief history of women in computing

We were twelve or thirteen women in a cohort of ninety-five.

It’s easy to forget that this hasn’t always been the case. Programming once had a very different gender balance, one that history has largely smoothed over. What feels normal now is, in fact, relatively recent.

In the early decades of computing, programming was not viewed as an elite technical pursuit. It was treated as careful, repetitive, and detail-oriented work—closer to clerical labor than engineering—and was therefore considered suitable for women. Many of the people who wrote the first programs, debugged early systems, and established foundational practices were women. Their work was essential, but rarely framed as exceptional.

As computing gained status, pay, and cultural prestige, the perception of who “belonged” in the field shifted with it. Programming became recast as difficult, abstract, and masculine. Hiring practices changed. Narratives changed. The people who had been there from the beginning were gradually written out of the story.

The result is the imbalance that now feels natural in classrooms like mine—an outcome often mistaken for a reflection of interest or aptitude, rather than the product of a long and quiet redefinition of the field itself.

I had to learn python was a stupid and easy language to learn depite the python community being the only ones i felt confortable - if you know the program pyladies, i was later a volunteer to teach
